Implementation Status IV. 4 The pilot CFL project, initiated in 2017 with the objective of exploring innovative and participatory approaches to financial literacy at the block level, has been scaled up based on experiences gained since its implementation. As a part of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI), it was envisaged to expand the reach of CFLs to cover the entire country by March 31, 2024. In consonance with this milestone, the CFL project was rolled out in three phases across the country. Starting with 80 CFLs, initially covering an equal number of blocks in the pilot phase, the project has expanded to 2,421 CFLs catering to 7,225 blocks, as on March 31, 2024. Funding support for the project is provided by the Depositor Education Awareness Fund (DEAF), The Reserve Bank continued with its agenda for furthering financial inclusion in the country as envisaged under the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI). Steps were taken for scaling up the Centre for Financial Literacy (CFL) project to cover the entire country by end-March 2024.
